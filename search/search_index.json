This provides an intuitive and fast way to execute commands without using a touchscreen, PC, or smartphone on your 3D printer.</p> </li> <li> <p>NeoPixel status indicators: Each button is equipped with a NeoPixel LED that can be individually programmed to display the status of the respective function or system. This means you always have clear visual feedback on the current status.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simple daisy-chain connection: The hardware buttons and NeoPixel LEDs are connected via a daisy chain, which enables uncomplicated cabling and expansion. This allows you to adapt the system to your needs flexibly.</p> </li> <li> <p>CANBUS support: The board can also be used as a USB-to-CAN adapter, making it a versatile solution for using toolhead boards in Klipper 3D printers. This enables stable and fast communication between the SBC/host and the toolhead boards via CANBUS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional interfaces: Besides the core functionality, the board also offers support for interfaces such as SPI and I2C, which provides extra flexibility for special applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open-source hardware and software: The Klipper Gcode-Buttons are based on open-source hardware and software. This allows you to adapt the system to your needs and expand it as required.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Klipper Gcode-Buttons offer a unique control and status display solution in 3D printers and automated systems. Executing gcodes directly via hardware buttons and displaying the status visually significantly increases user-friendliness. The CANBUS support as a USB-to-CAN adapter and the additional interfaces, such as SPI and I2C, offer extra benefits and significantly expand the application possibilities.</p>"},{"location":"hardware/button-boards/","title":"Button Boards","text":"<p>The Button Boards are specially developed PCBs that enable intuitive and visually appealing control for Klipper-based 3D printers. These small PCBs have two versions: one for Cherry-MX buttons and one for Romer-G (B3K-T1RL) buttons. Both versions offer a high-quality, precise switching mechanism specially developed for demanding applications.</p> <p></p> <p>Each button board is equipped with a NeoPixel, which illuminates the button from behind and serves as a status indicator. This LED can be individually programmed to visualize the system's current status or specific functions. This integrated lighting provides an aesthetic enhancement and clear visual feedback directly on the push-button.</p> <p>Solder pads are placed on the PCBs to set the order of the buttons in the daisy chain. The button boards are connected via FFC/FPC flat cables with 8 pins and a 0.5 mm pitch, which ensures simple and tidy cabling.</p> <p>The Button Boards, therefore, offer an excellent combination of functionality, flexibility, and design, making them the ideal addition to any Klipper-based control system.
