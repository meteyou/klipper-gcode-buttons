# Klipper Gcode-Buttons

The Klipper Gcode-Buttons offer an innovative control option specially developed to improve operation and status display
in 3D printing and automation systems. This solution supports ten hardware buttons, each equipped with a NeoPixel LED.
These buttons allow execution of gcodes directly while providing visual feedback on the current status via the
integrated NeoPixel LEDs.

## Features from the Klipper Gcode-Buttons

- **Hardware buttons:** Klipper Gcode-Buttons allow you to use up to 10 physical buttons to execute gcodes directly.
This provides an intuitive and fast way to execute commands without using a touchscreen, PC, or smartphone on your 3D
printer.

- **NeoPixel status indicators:** Each button is equipped with a NeoPixel LED that can be individually programmed to
display the status of the respective function or system. This means you always have clear visual feedback on the current
status.

- **Simple daisy-chain connection:** The hardware buttons and NeoPixel LEDs are connected via a daisy chain, which
enables uncomplicated cabling and expansion. This allows you to adapt the system to your needs flexibly.

- **CANBUS support:** The board can also be used as a **USB-to-CAN** adapter, making it a versatile solution for using
toolhead boards in Klipper 3D printers. This enables stable and fast communication between the SBC/host and the toolhead
boards via CANBUS.

- **Additional interfaces:** Besides the core functionality, the board also offers support for interfaces such as SPI
and I2C, which provides extra flexibility for special applications.

- **Open-source hardware and software:** The Klipper Gcode-Buttons are based on open-source hardware and software. This
allows you to adapt the system to your needs and expand it as required.

The Klipper Gcode-Buttons offer a unique control and status display solution in 3D printers and automated systems.
Executing gcodes directly via hardware buttons and displaying the status visually significantly increases
user-friendliness. The CANBUS support as a USB-to-CAN adapter and the additional interfaces, such as SPI and I2C, offer
extra benefits and significantly expand the application possibilities.
